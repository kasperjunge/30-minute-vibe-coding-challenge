# Requirements: Claude Plugin Marketplace

## Project Overview
A public web-based marketplace for Claude Code plugins, inspired by Hugging Face's model for sharing and discovery. Plugin creators can upload and share their plugins through a web interface, while users can browse, discover, and integrate plugins into Claude Code via the standard `/plugin marketplace add` command.

## Target Users
**Plugin Creators**: Individual developers who have created Claude Code plugins locally and want to share them with the community.

**Plugin Consumers**: Individual developers using Claude Code who want to discover and install community-created plugins to extend their capabilities.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Creator Uploads a Plugin
**As a** plugin creator  
**I want to** upload my locally-developed plugin to the marketplace  
**So that** other developers can discover and use my plugin

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] I can create an account with email and password
- [ ] I can log in to my account
- [ ] I can upload a plugin directory as a zip file
- [ ] The system validates that the plugin has required structure (.claude-plugin/plugin.json)
- [ ] After upload, my plugin appears in the marketplace immediately
- [ ] I can see a confirmation that my plugin was published successfully

**Edge Cases:**
- What happens if plugin.json is missing or malformed?
- What happens if a plugin with the same name already exists from me?
- What happens if upload fails mid-process?
- What happens if the zip file is corrupted or too large?

### Story 2: Creator Manages Their Plugins
**As a** plugin creator  
**I want to** view and update my published plugins  
**So that** I can fix bugs and add features over time

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] I can see a list of all my published plugins
- [ ] I can upload a new version of an existing plugin
- [ ] Each plugin page shows version history
- [ ] I can see which version is currently "latest"
- [ ] I can view my public profile showing all my plugins

**Edge Cases:**
- What happens if I try to upload an older version number than what's published?
- What happens if I try to update someone else's plugin?

### Story 3: User Discovers Plugins
**As a** Claude Code user  
**I want to** browse available plugins in a web interface  
**So that** I can find plugins that solve my needs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] I can view a homepage with all available plugins (grid or list view)
- [ ] I can see plugin name, author, description, and version for each plugin
- [ ] I can search plugins by text (searches name and description)
- [ ] I can sort plugins by newest first or alphabetically
- [ ] I can click on a plugin to see its detailed page

**Edge Cases:**
- What happens when there are zero plugins (empty state)?
- What happens when search returns no results?
- What happens when there are hundreds of plugins (pagination)?

### Story 4: User Views Plugin Details
**As a** Claude Code user  
**I want to** see detailed information about a plugin  
**So that** I can decide if it meets my needs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Plugin page shows name, author, description, version, upload date
- [ ] Plugin page displays README.md content with markdown rendering (if present)
- [ ] Plugin page lists components (commands, agents, skills, hooks, MCP servers)
- [ ] Plugin page shows installation instructions with copy-paste commands
- [ ] Plugin page has a "Download ZIP" button
- [ ] Plugin page shows version history

**Edge Cases:**
- What happens if plugin has no README?
- What happens if README is malformed markdown?
- What happens if plugin has no components in standard directories?

### Story 5: User Installs Plugin via Claude Code
**As a** Claude Code user  
**I want to** install a plugin from the marketplace into Claude Code  
**So that** I can use the plugin's features in my projects

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Marketplace generates a marketplace.json file accessible at a public URL
- [ ] The marketplace.json follows Claude Code's schema specification
- [ ] I can add the marketplace in Claude Code with `/plugin marketplace add https://yoursite.com/marketplace.json`
- [ ] I can see all marketplace plugins when running `/plugin` in Claude Code
- [ ] I can install any plugin with `/plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name`
- [ ] The plugin downloads and installs successfully in Claude Code

**Edge Cases:**
- What happens if marketplace.json is invalid?
- What happens if plugin download URL is broken?
- What happens when marketplace has no plugins?

### Story 6: User Reports Problematic Plugin
**As a** Claude Code user  
**I want to** report a plugin that is broken or malicious  
**So that** the marketplace maintains quality and safety

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Each plugin page has a "Report" button
- [ ] Clicking report shows a simple form (reason for report, optional details)
- [ ] After submitting, I see confirmation that report was received
- [ ] I don't need an account to report a plugin

**Edge Cases:**
- What happens if someone submits spam reports?
- What happens if I report the same plugin multiple times?

### Story 7: Admin Reviews Reports
**As a** marketplace administrator  
**I want to** review reported plugins and take action  
**So that** I can maintain marketplace quality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] I can access an admin dashboard (separate from normal user views)
- [ ] Dashboard shows all reported plugins with report details
- [ ] I can unpublish a plugin to remove it from marketplace
- [ ] Unpublished plugins disappear from public listings and marketplace.json
- [ ] Creator is notified (via email) when their plugin is unpublished

**Edge Cases:**
- What happens to users who already installed an unpublished plugin?
- Can a creator re-upload an unpublished plugin?
- What if there are no reports (empty state)?

## Out of Scope
The following features are explicitly excluded from the initial version:

- GitHub integration or auto-sync from repositories
- OAuth login (Google, GitHub)
- Plugin ratings or review system
- Usage statistics or download counts
- Featured/trending sections
- Social features (favorites, following, collections)
- Tags or categories for plugins
- Plugin dependencies management
- Automated testing of uploaded plugins
- Paid or premium plugins
- Team or organization accounts
- Plugin analytics for creators
- Email notifications for plugin updates
- API for programmatic access
- Multiple marketplaces per installation (curated lists)
- Plugin editing in web UI
- Automatic update notifications in Claude Code
- Plugin search filters beyond text search
- Advanced admin features (bulk actions, detailed analytics)
- Mobile app or mobile-optimized views

## Success Criteria
How we measure if this project succeeded:

- [ ] At least 10 plugins uploaded by external creators within first month
- [ ] Users can successfully complete the full workflow: browse → find plugin → install in Claude Code
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in plugin installation process
- [ ] Admin can moderate reported plugins within 24 hours
- [ ] marketplace.json is valid and consumable by Claude Code
- [ ] Average plugin upload time under 5 minutes (from zip creation to published)

## Open Questions
Remaining uncertainties to resolve before design phase:

- What is the maximum file size limit for plugin uploads?
- Should we allow plugin names with special characters or enforce kebab-case?
- How long should version history be retained (all versions forever or limit to last N)?
- Should unpublished plugins be soft-deleted (recoverable) or hard-deleted?
- What constitutes a valid report (free-form text only or structured reasons)?
- Should there be rate limiting on uploads (e.g., max 10 plugins per day per user)?
- What happens if two creators try to upload plugins with identical names?
