# Requirements: Breath Training App

## Project Overview
A web-based breath training application designed to help users reduce stress through guided breathing exercises. The app provides evidence-based breathing patterns with visual and audio guidance, tracks user progress, and helps build a consistent stress-relief practice.

## Target Users
People experiencing daily stress who want quick, accessible relief through breathing exercises. This includes both complete beginners to breathwork and those with some meditation experience. Users may be at work, at home, or anywhere they need a moment of calm and have internet access.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Quick Stress Relief
**As a** stressed user  
**I want to** start a breathing exercise immediately  
**So that** I can quickly calm down when feeling overwhelmed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can begin a breathing exercise within 2 clicks from app load
- [ ] Default breathing pattern starts automatically for returning users who have set a preference
- [ ] Visual animation provides clear guidance on when to inhale, hold, and exhale
- [ ] Session continues smoothly without interruptions or confusing UI elements
- [ ] User can pause or stop the session at any time

**Edge Cases:**
- What happens if user closes browser tab mid-session?
- What happens if user switches browser tabs during session?
- What happens if user loses internet connection during a session?

### Story 2: Explore Different Breathing Techniques
**As a** user exploring stress-relief options  
**I want to** try different breathing patterns  
**So that** I can find the technique that works best for me

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can browse at least 3 different breathing patterns (Box Breathing, 4-7-8 Breathing, Coherent Breathing)
- [ ] Each pattern includes a brief description of its benefits and recommended use
- [ ] User can preview pattern timing before starting a full session
- [ ] User can switch between patterns easily
- [ ] Each pattern follows evidence-based timing protocols

**Edge Cases:**
- What happens if user starts one pattern, stops it, then starts a different one?
- Should partial sessions with different patterns be tracked separately?

### Story 3: Build a Consistent Practice
**As a** user committed to stress management  
**I want to** track my breathing practice over time  
**So that** I stay motivated and see my progress

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can see total number of sessions completed
- [ ] User can see current consecutive day streak
- [ ] User can see total minutes practiced
- [ ] User can view a simple weekly calendar showing which days they practiced
- [ ] Statistics update immediately after completing a session
- [ ] Streak increments only once per calendar day (multiple sessions in one day don't break or multi-count for streak)

**Edge Cases:**
- What happens to streak if user misses a day?
- What timezone should be used for "daily" tracking?
- What if user practices at 11:59 PM then again at 12:01 AM?

### Story 4: Customize Practice Duration
**As a** busy user with varying amounts of time  
**I want to** choose how long my breathing session lasts  
**So that** I can fit practice into my schedule whether I have 2 minutes or 10 minutes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can select session duration before starting (2, 5, or 10 minutes)
- [ ] Timer counts down and shows remaining time during session
- [ ] Session ends automatically when time is up
- [ ] User can end session early if needed
- [ ] Sessions that are at least 50% complete count toward progress tracking

**Edge Cases:**
- What happens if user ends session after 10 seconds?
- Should very short sessions (< 30 seconds) count at all?

### Story 5: First-Time User Onboarding
**As a** first-time user  
**I want to** understand how the app works  
**So that** I feel confident using it and get value immediately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] First-time users see a brief, calming welcome screen
- [ ] Onboarding includes a short sample breathing exercise (30 seconds) to demonstrate functionality
- [ ] Instructions are clear and minimal (no overwhelming text)
- [ ] User can skip onboarding if desired
- [ ] After onboarding, user can immediately start a full session
- [ ] Onboarding only shows once per user account

**Edge Cases:**
- What if user closes browser during onboarding?
- Should returning users ever see onboarding again?

### Story 6: Manage Account and Preferences
**As a** registered user  
**I want to** log in and out securely  
**So that** my practice history is saved and private

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can create an account with email and password
- [ ] User can log in with their credentials
- [ ] User can log out
- [ ] User remains logged in across browser sessions (until explicit logout)
- [ ] Password meets basic security requirements (minimum length, complexity)
- [ ] User cannot access practice history without being logged in

**Edge Cases:**
- What happens if user forgets password?
- What if user tries to create account with already-used email?
- Should there be email verification?

### Story 7: Receive Practice Reminders
**As a** user building a new habit  
**I want to** set optional reminders  
**So that** I remember to practice daily and maintain my streak

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can enable/disable daily reminders
- [ ] User can set preferred time for reminder
- [ ] Reminders are optional (disabled by default)
- [ ] User can change reminder time at any time
- [ ] Reminder appears as browser notification if user has granted permission

**Edge Cases:**
- What if user denies browser notification permissions?
- What if user is already in an active session when reminder triggers?
- What if browser is closed at reminder time?

### Story 8: Adjust Breathing Pattern Timing (Advanced)
**As an** experienced user  
**I want to** adjust breathing pattern timing  
**So that** I can match my personal comfort level and lung capacity

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can access advanced settings for pattern customization
- [ ] User can adjust inhale, hold, exhale durations independently
- [ ] Adjustments are saved per pattern
- [ ] User can reset to expert-recommended defaults
- [ ] Visual animation adapts to custom timing
- [ ] This feature is clearly marked as "Advanced" to avoid confusing beginners

**Edge Cases:**
- What are minimum/maximum values for timing adjustments?
- What if user creates an unhealthy pattern (e.g., 1 second inhale, 60 second hold)?

### Story 9: Complete a Session and Get Feedback
**As a** user finishing a breathing session  
**I want to** see what I accomplished  
**So that** I feel satisfied and motivated to continue

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Completion screen shows pattern used
- [ ] Completion screen shows duration completed
- [ ] Completion screen shows time of day session was completed
- [ ] Updated streak is displayed if this is first session of the day
- [ ] Positive, non-cheesy encouragement message is shown
- [ ] User can start another session or return to home screen

**Edge Cases:**
- What if this was a partial session (ended early)?
- Should the message change based on streak milestones (e.g., 7 days, 30 days)?

- [ ] App works on both desktop and mobile web browsers
- [ ] User testing shows 80%+ of test users find the breathing guidance clear and helpful
- [ ] No critical bugs in core functionality (authentication, session tracking, breathing animation)

## Open Questions
Questions to resolve before design phase:
- Should we require email verification during registration, or allow immediate access?
- What specific wording/tone should encouragement messages use (clinical, friendly, zen-like)?
- Should the weekly view show only current week, or allow scrolling through history?
- What happens to user data if they don't log in for 6 months or 1 year (data retention policy)?
- Should there be a "guest mode" that allows trying the app without creating an account?
- What analytics/metrics should we track (if any) to understand user engagement?
